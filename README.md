TASK DISTRIBUTION OF RELATED FIELDS

1.5.1.1. Mechanical designs & Calculations

It is very important to make correct measurements and calculations during the construction of our remote control RC car in order not to cause any errors and extra costs. The most important parts of our project are the lower body, upper body and mechanical parts that make up the main skeleton of the car. Because if these parts do not work correctly and without errors, the continuity of the project cannot be ensured. We chose the necessary mechanical and other parts with the measurements we determined in line with the calculations we made during the planning of our project.The most important parts of our project; The car chassis section, engine selection, power and torque calculations of the engines, the differential system required for power and torque transmission from the engine to the wheels, the steering system required for car turns, the spring system protecting the car underbody and the outer and body design of the car are generally mechanical tasks.


1.5.1.1.1. The Car Chassis Section:
The most important and main carrier part of our project is the chassis. This is the part that we will start to do first in our tool. It is the main support and skeleton structure that carries all the parts attached to it, such as the engines, wheels, electrical systems, spring system and outer body on and under our car. The chassis system we will build will have a length of 40 cm and a width of 20 cm.With this length and width, all other necessary mechanisms can be safely placed on and under the car. During the construction of the chassis, aluminum profile will be used due to its cheap cost, light, durable and long-lasting. and Wooden material will be used for the space in the middle of the chassis, since it is cheaper and lighter. In the example picture you see below, it is seen what we want to do.

FİGURE 1.
1.5.1.1.2. Body Design :  
After all the mechanical, electronic and software processes on the car are finished and connected to the car chassis, our next task is the outer body placement section, which will make the car look beautiful. First of all, the vehicle exterior body design will be made through the solidworks program with the most accurate calculations, taking into account the wheels and other systems in line with the dimensions of the sub-chassis we have planned.With this solidworks design program, in which we have designed the car body, the actual design of the outer body will be produced in the most beautiful and least costly way and can be easily mounted on our vehicle.This outer body to be produced will be strong enough to support 2 to 3 kg of weight.


FİGURE 2.















1.5.1.1.3. Spring System :
We will install a suspension system on our vehicle to ensure driving comfort on rough and flat roads and the safety of all other systems in the vehicle. 4 leaf spring systems will be used on our vehicle.This leaf spring system is a suspension system that rovides driving comfort and driving safety by storing the energy created by the loads coming to the chassis and transmission units suddenly in different road conditions. We will produce the spring system we will use for our vehicle ourselves because it is less costly. For this leaf spring system, a chainsaw mainspring with a high coefficient of elasticity and a long service life will be used. this mainspring wire will be cut in specified lengths and will take the desired appearance with the help of necessary fasteners.

FİGURE 3.
1.5.1.1.4. Steering System:

The steering system is the system that enables the vehicle to go (steered) in the desired direction by the driver. With the help of the MG996 12 kg servo motor, which we will use, the car can be controlled remotely by the driver. The turning force will be transmitted to the wheels via the steering tie rods, by increasing the force and converting it into linear motion with the servo motor used for steering.we will make the front steering system on the vehicle ourselves in line with the necessary measurements and calculations.







1.5.1.1.5. Engine Calculations:
We will use two different engines on our vehicle. One of these motors is the RS775 DC motor, which will provide the driving force of the vehicle. the other is the MG995 12kg servo motor that allows us to control the vehicle's steering system. During the main planning of our project, the correct engine selection was made by considering the battery to be used in the car, all other systems, and all regions where the vehicle will operate in line with the general work duties of the car. First of all, when we started our project, it will be calculated how much power the servo motor we use in the steering system should apply while working with the weight acting on the car. Then, the power and speed of the dc motor, which is the driving force of the vehicle, will be calculated, and all calculations of how much speed, power and torque is transferred from the engine to the wheels with the differential system we will design.


FIGURE 4.
1.5.1.1.6. Car Differential System :
The system that connects the two wheels and the engine within the vehicle chassis and provides the balance between the two wheels is called the differential system. It provides differential rotation of the rear wheels and increased torque. It transmits the movement it receives from the shaft, which is connected with the engine, to the wheels by turning it 90 degrees. In this project, we will design and manufacture our own differential system. We will design the differential system by making gear calculations according to the engine and battery power we will use in the vehicle. Then , the speedand torque produced by the vehicle will be increased by the updates to be made in the dimensions and numbers of the gears and other mechanisms to be used in the differential system we designed after the production of the car .
FIGURE 5.
1.5.1.2. Desktop Application:
The modern automobile is a marvel of engineering, and its software system is no exception. The car's various systems – from the navigation system to the engine control unit (ECU) – need to communicate to operate correctly. This communication is usually facilitated by dedicated wiring harnesses that connect the ECUs to the car's other systems. Typically, these harnesses consist of a long series of wires, each containing information relevant to the operation of its associated system. For example, a wire connected to the ECU for the braking system carries data that controls the operation of the brakes. A wire connected to the engine control is responsible for controlling the speed of the engine. By running multiple wires from a single harness, car manufacturers can ensure that there is no data loss or corruption while transmitting information from the car's various systems to its control system. Designing a reliable and efficient wiring harness is a crucial component of building a modern car. Desktop programming plays an integral role in this process. Desktop programmers are responsible for designing and writing code that controls the various functions of the wiring harness. This code must be written to conform to the specific requirements of the electrical system of the car in question.

1.5.1.3. Network Types & Information:
There are several different types of networks that can be used to control a multi-purpose radio control car. Some of the most common include:
1-Radio Frequency (RF) networks: These networks use radio waves to transmitcommands from a remote control to the car. RF networks are often used in remote control cars because they can operate over long distances and are relatively inexpensive to implement.
2-Infrared (IR) networks: These networks use infrared light to transmit commands from a remote control to the car. IR networks are often used in remote control cars because they are easy to implement and require minimal hardware.
3-Bluetooth networks: These networks use Bluetooth technology to transmit commands from a remote control or other device to the car. Bluetooth networks are often used in remote control cars because they are easy to set up and offer a high degree of flexibility.
4-Wi-Fi networks: These networks use wireless internet to connect the remote control or other device to the car. Wi-Fi networks are often used in remote control cars because they are easy to set up and offer a high degree of flexibility.
5-Cellular networks: These networks use cellular technology to connect the remote control or other device to the car. Cellular networks are often used in remote control cars because they are easy to set up and offer a high degree of flexibility.The type of network used will depend on the specific needs of the remote control car, as well as the capabilities of the remote control device and the car itself.
1.5.1.4. Mobile Program Design:


FİGURE 6. Example of Mobile Program User Interface

On the mobile interface, there will be buttons that can control the vehicle and a video display function.

FIGURE 9. Remote Control Car Market Research Report Insights 2028
4.1.3 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

Companies like Tamagochi have RC cars built with artificial Intelligence, Traxxas Rustler's electronics are sealed, which makes it possible for the RC car to run in water, mud, snow and other environments, it can also reach speeds of up to 56km/h. Big companies that produce rc cars like this one have dominated a very important market in their field. these companies use the latest technology and for this reason the products they produce are sold at much higher prices than other products. some middle-class companies, on the other hand, produce vehicles equipped to meet their needs, even if they do not produce the best in their class, so that people with lower purchasing power can buy them.




4.2. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS



4.2.1.Risk ANALYSIS

4.2.1.1. Component Damage
Many of the biggest problems any team can face are damaging their gear. One problem that RC cars can have in proper operation is having faulty hardware or connections. Physical damage can also be a factor, as our project is also mobile and exposed to the elements. Having a solid mechanical car frame is essential to ensure that a control failure resulting in a collision does not damage the electronics inside the vehicle. Ensuring that the electronics are isolated from environmental factors such as water and sand ejected from the tires is also important for the protection of our equipment.


     4.2.1.2.Programming and Time Allocation
Managing time well and finishing everything on time is an important factor in projects. Most of the work done during our design can be performed independently of other events, but some still depend on others. For example, if the web interface and phone programming are not already working, there will be no way to test our communication from our web page to the phone. Therefore, ensuring that tasks are completed on time is instrumental in ensuring that projects are completed on time.
